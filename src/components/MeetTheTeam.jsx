Nick went above and beyond during this process to help me. In addition to helping me find a job, Nick was a constant mentor to me. He never hesitated to share his insights with me and was a calming voice of reason many times. Along the way, I got to know Nick -- he's an amazing human being who cares about the people he is trying help. It was always extremely easy to connect with Nick. I never felt like I was talking to a recruiter; I always felt like I was talking to a friend. This all speaks to the fact that he has years of experience in his industry. He knows what he's talking about and he excels at connecting with people. I'm glad to call Nick a friend and can't speak highly enough about him.",
